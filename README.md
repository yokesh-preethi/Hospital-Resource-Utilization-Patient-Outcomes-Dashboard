# Hospital-Resource-Utilization-Patient-Outcomes-Dashboard
📊 Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze hospital resource utilization and patient outcomes across multiple departments.

The dashboard provides insights into:

Patient admissions and discharge trends

Emergency vs scheduled cases

Department-wise workload and doctor utilization

Cost per patient and billing patterns

Patient outcomes (Recovered, Improved, Transferred, Deceased)

Interactive slicers enable filtering by hospital branch, department, gender, insurance type, and time period, making the dashboard easy to use for non-technical users.

The dataset was synthetically generated using Python to simulate real-world hospital operations.
This solution helps hospital administrators identify operational bottlenecks, optimize staffing decisions, improve cost efficiency, and enhance patient care outcomes.
